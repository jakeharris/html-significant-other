# html-significant-other package

Just like your cute thing does two weeks after you start dating, this package finishes your (HTML) sentences for you.

`html-significant-other` will add ending tags to your HTML tags that need it as you type.

## Remaining issues
- **Won't recognize that the tag is closed if it is closed on a different line**
- There are several cases where it won't help you (e.g. a line with inline JS with a "<"), though in these cases it will do nothing
