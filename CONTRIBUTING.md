## Assumptions
- Opening tags **never** begin with anything but '<' and then an immediate alphabetic character, i.e. no spaces between the < and the letter
- Closing tags **never** begin with anything but '</'

## Design paradigm
Don't get in the way. If it doesn't work right, do nothing.

## Coding standards
- Avoid semicolons where possible
- Opening brackets on same line as block identifier
